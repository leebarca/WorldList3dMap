Its landscape is dominated by the rugged Hindu Kush mountains, with climates that range from harsh winters in the highlands to hot summers in the lowlands. Known for its complex history, Afghanistan has been a cultural and political intersection for various empires, from ancient Persian and Greek civilizations to Islamic empires. More recently, it has faced decades of conflict, including the Soviet invasion, civil war, and the rise and fall of the Taliban, which regained power in 2021. Afghan culture is deeply rooted in ethnic diversity, with Pashtuns, Tajiks, Hazaras, Uzbeks, and others valuing hospitality, family, and tradition. Afghan cuisine includes rice dishes, lamb, chicken, and breads like bolani, with tea as a staple. While primarily an agricultural economy, Afghanistan has untapped mineral resources, though political instability continues to challenge economic growth. Despite ongoing struggles, Afghanistan’s rich history, resilience, and cultural heritage remain integral to its identity.</string>
